# Data

These directories contain log files with readings from various sensors,
including GPS, IMU, and Pedometer data. Many of the logs contain noisy,
inaccurate, or invalid data. These are denoted by an asterisk in the
list below. Each item describes the start and end locations (on the MIT
campus) for the corresponding directory. log.csv corresponds to GPS data
while every other log corresponds to the sensor in its filename. The GPS
data can be converted to a KML file using the csv2kml.py script and
plotted on Google My Maps.
